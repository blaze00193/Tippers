## ðŸ”‚ What Each Contract Does

**CoinFlip.sol** - Sends a Request to ChainLink VRF to get a random number, check if the random number is a modulus of 2 i.e ``randomNumber % 2``. Set the selection depending on what the user picks either by  ``1 or 0`` that is an Head or tail. if the random number  chainlink vrf gives is a modulus of 2 then the ``enum`` is set to ``0`` if otherwise ``1``, if the user's choice is equal to any of the selection, the user gets two times of his/her stake.

| Title | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `chainlink VRF` | `number` | **get**. get a random number|
| `choice` | `number` | **Required**. user bet choice |
| `Selection` | `Object` | **event**. set the enum selection base on the random number result|


**Dice.sol** - Sends a Request to ChainLink VRF to get two random numbers within the range of ``1-6``, the selection is set depending on what the user picks either by  ``1 or 0`` that is greater than 6 or less than 6. if the addition of what chainlink vrf random numbers gives us is greater than 6 then the ``enum`` is set to ``0`` if otherwise ``1``, if the user's choice is equal to any of the selection, the user gets two times of his/her stake. [see more](https://github.com/Samuellyworld/Tippers/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/Dice.sol)

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `chainlink VRF` | `number` | **get**. get two random numbers between 1-6|
| `choice` | `number` | **Required**. user bet choice |
| `Selection` | `Object` | **event**. set the enum selection base on the random numbers result |

**Wheel.sol** - Sends a Request to chainlink VRF to get a random number between the range of ``0 to 6``. if the number is ``0 or 4``, the user get exactly the same amount staked. if the number is between ``1 or 5``, the users get two times of his or her stake. if the number is ``3``, the user get 1/2 of his/her stake.

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `chainlink VRF` | `number` | **get**. get a random number between 0-6|
