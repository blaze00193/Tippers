 ## üí´ Problem Description.
Blockchain is an innovative ecosystem that has garnered a lot of attention and developments over the years. The technology however is still under utilized. Less than 3% of the world's population use the Blockchain. 

The Polygon ecosystem however, needs to build more, in the day to day activities of people to be able to capture more of the world‚Äôs population.

Decentralized Finance, NFTs and Gaming have proven to be helpful to blockchain adoption.
Polygon is committed to fostering the growth of Web3 applications by providing the infrastructure needed for Web3.

There is the need for more innovations in the aspect of casino gaming with utilities. The Polygon ecosystem needs a far more decentralized gaming application, that would focus more on the anonymity of players, reputation, partnership with players in the ecosystem and continuous improvement and additions to accommodate players from every sphere.

## ‚úÖ Solution Approach.
The long term goal of Tippers is to provide over 100 games to game lovers on the Polygon blockchain launching with 3 games, and engaging with the community to develop as many games as possible.

Also Another long term goal is to launch an NFT collection on the Polygon Blockchain.
The NFT collection artwork would be in the PFP category and holders of the NFT would get a percentage of game fees. This, in essence, would bring marketing and visibility to Tippers and help in engaging with the Polygon Ecosystem.
